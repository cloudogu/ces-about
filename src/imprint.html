                        <strong>Liability for content</strong><br/>
                        As a service provider, pursuant to § 7 para. 1 TMG we are responsible for our own content on these web pages according to general laws. However, according to §§ 8 through 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor transferred or stored external information or to search for circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

                <p>
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected by this. Liability in this respect however is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific infringement of the law. Upon becoming aware of such legal infringements, we will immediately remove this content.

                <p>
                        <strong>Liability for links</strong><br/>
                        Our website contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
                </p>
                <p>
                        However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of such legal infringements, we will immediately remove this content.
