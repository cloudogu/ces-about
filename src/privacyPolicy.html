      <p>Cloudogu GmbH ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://cloudogu.net website (the "Service").</p>
      <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when
        you use our Service.</p>
      <p>We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
      <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
        data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. If personal data (for example
        name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our web pages, this always takes place to the extent possible
        on a voluntary basis. This data is not shared with third parties without your express consent.</p>
      <p>Please note that the transfer of data on the internet (for example via email communication) may have security
        gaps. Gap-free protection of the data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Collection And Use</strong></p>
      <p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can
        be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your
        email address, name, other information ("Personal Information").</p>
      <p><strong>Server log files</strong></p>
      <p>The provider of the web pages automatically collects and stores information in the server log files that your
        browser transfers to us automatically. These are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Browser type and version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referring URL</li>
        <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. A combination of this data with other data sources is not
        performed. We reserve the right to review this data at a later time if we become aware of any concrete
        indications of unlawful use.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>Our web pages may use “cookies”. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain viruses. Cookies help
        make our website more user-friendly, effective, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your
        computer and saved by your browser.</p>
      <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies". They are automatically deleted at the end of your
        visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize
        your browser the next time you visit our website.</p>
      <p>You can set your browser so that you are notified about the creation of cookies and to only allow cookies in
        individual cases, to prevent the acceptance of cookies either generally or in certain cases, and enable the
        automatic deletion of the cookies upon closing the browser. When cookies are deactivated, the functionality of
        this website may be limited.</p>
      <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
      <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our
        behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>
      <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

      <div *ngIf="isGA">
        <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong></p>
        <p>Instances of Cloudogu EcoSystem hosted on the domain cloudogu.net might use fuctions of the web analytics
          service Google Analytics. The provider is Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
          USA.</p>
        <p>Google Analytics uses "cookies". These are text files that are stored on your computer and which enable an
          analysis of your use of the website. The data generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website is
          generally transferred to a Google server located in the USA and stored there.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>IP anonymization</strong><br/>
          We have enabled the IP anonymization function on this website. This causes your IP address to be shortened by
          Google within Member States of the European Union or in other countries party to the Agreement on the European
          Economic Area before being transferred to the USA. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be
          transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website,
          Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity,
          and to provide the website operator with other services relating to website and internet use. The IP address
          transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Browser plugin</strong><br/>
          You may refuse the storage of cookies via a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, please
          note that if you do this, you may not be able to use all functions of this website to their full extent. You
          can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and related to your use (including
          your IP address) as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser
          plugin available at the following link: <a traget="_blank"
                                                     href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Objection to data collection</strong><br/>
        <p>You may find more information on the handling of user data by Google Analytics in the privacy policy of
          Google: <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a>
        </p>
        <p>You can also deactivate the Google Analytics data collection for your current browser by clicking this link:
          <a href="javascript:gaOptout();"
             onclick="alert('The tracking by Google Analytics for this website has been deactivated in this browser.');">Deactivate
            data collection by Google Analytics for this website</a></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Contracted data processing</strong><br/>
          We have concluded a contract with Google for data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of
          the German data protection authorities with our use of Google Analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Google Analytics demographics data</strong><br/>
        <p>This website uses the "Demographics" function of Google Analytics. This allows reports to be generated that
          contain data on the age, gender, and interests of website visitors.</p>
        <p>This data is derived from interest-driven advertisement by Google as well as visitor data from third party
          providers. This data cannot be assigned to a specific person. You can disable this function at any time via
          the display settings in your Google account, or generally refuse the collection of your data by Google
          Analytics as described in the section "Objection to data collection".</p>

      <p>This site uses SSL encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content,
        such as requests you send to us as a site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that

        bar.</p>
      <p>If SSL encryption is activated, the data that you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
      <p><strong>Links To Other Sites</strong></p>

        you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every
        site you visit.</p>
      <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
        third party sites or services.</p>
      <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
      <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").</p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or
        guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Information, please contact us. If
