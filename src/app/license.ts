            <b>Preamble</b>

            <p>
              The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General
              Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software
              is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software
              and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
              covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make
              sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
              that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of
              it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
            </p>

            <p>
              To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
              the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
              software, or if you modify it.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the
              rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show
              them these terms so they know their rights.
            </p>

            <p>
              We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
              to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty
              for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
              know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
              the original authors' reputations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of
              a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
              this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
            </p>

            <p>
              The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
            </p>


            <b>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</b>


            <p>
              0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
              copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program",
              below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
              derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
              verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
              without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
            </p>

            <p>
              Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
              The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
              constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
              is true depends on what the Program does.
            </p>

            <p>
              1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive
              it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
              notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence
              of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
            </p>

            <p>
              You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
              exchange for a fee.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a
              work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
              above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
            </p>

            <dl>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
                the files and the date of any change.
              </dd>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains
                or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
                under the terms of this License.
              </dd>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause
                it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement
                including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
                provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
                how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally
                print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
              These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
              Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
              and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute
              the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must
              be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus
              to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contoggle your rights to work written entirely by you; rather,
              the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
              the Program.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program)
              on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
              code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
            </p>

            <!-- we use this doubled UL to get the sub-sections indented, -->
            <!-- while making the bullets as unobvious as possible. -->

            <dl>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
                be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
                or,
              </dd>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third
                party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
                copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
                customarily used for software interchange; or,
              </dd>
              <dt></dt>
              <dd>
                c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding
                source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
                program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
              </dd>
            </dl>

            <p>
              The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete
              source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
              files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
              exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
              or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
              executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
            </p>

            <p>
              If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
              access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
              parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided
              under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
              will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
              rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
              in full compliance.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
              else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited
              by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
              based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions
              for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.
            </p>

            <p>
              6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
              automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
              to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
              rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
            </p>

            <p>
              7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
              other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
              or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of
              this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License
              and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,
              if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
              directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
              refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
            </p>

            <p>
              If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
              is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contoggle
              validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
              distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions
              to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
              system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
              system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
            </p>

            <p>
              8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either
              by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
              may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
              permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
              as if written in the body of this License.
            </p>

            <p>
              9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public
              License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
              in detail to address new problems or concerns.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
              to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
              or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
              number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
            </p>

            <p>
              10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
              conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
              Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
              decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software
              and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
            </p>

            <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

            <p>
              11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM,
              TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
              OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
              BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
              RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
              ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
            </p>

            <p>
              12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
              HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO
              YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
              OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
              OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
              EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

        			<p>Copyright © 2023 Cloudogu GmbH</p>
							<p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
							DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
				 			<p>1. DEFINITIONS</p>
							<p>"Contribution" means:</p>
							<p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
							<p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
							<p>i) changes to the Program, and</p>
							<p>ii) additions to the Program;</p>
							where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
				 			'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
							Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
							under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
							"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
							"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
				 			alone or when combined with the Program.
							"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
							"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>
			 				<p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
							<p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
			 				reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
							such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</p>
							<p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
							 Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object
							code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
							such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which
				 			include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</p>
							<p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
			 				Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability
							to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
							licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third
 							party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</p>
							<p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth
			 				in this Agreement.</p>
							<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
							A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
							<p>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
							<p>b) its license agreement:</p>
							<p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
							and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
							<p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
							<p>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
							<p>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
							used for software exchange.</p>
							When the Program is made available in source code form:
							<p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
							<p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
							Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
							Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. </p>
							<p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
							<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial 
							use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
							if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
							("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the
							Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.
							The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
							a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and
							b)allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
							The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
							For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.
							If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties
							are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
							related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
							<p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
							<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
							EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
							FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and
							assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
							compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
							<p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
							<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
							INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
							WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
							OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
							<p>7. GENERAL</p>
							<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
							remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
							necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
							<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
							itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
							granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
							<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement
							and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
							Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations
							under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
							<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted
							and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions)
							of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
							The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward
							to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)
							may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is
							published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
							in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
							whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.</p>
							<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America.
							No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose.
							Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>

            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</li>

              <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
              </li>

              <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark,
                and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

              <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
                must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
                notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
                within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
                if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
                purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
                that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
                <br>
                <br> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
                license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
                Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                with the conditions stated in this License.
              </li>
            </ul>

              5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
              submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
              License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
              or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
            <p>
              6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
              service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
              the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
            <p>
              7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
              provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
              OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible
              for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with
              Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
            <p>
              8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
              negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
              acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
              special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
              the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
              computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

              9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
              Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
              other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
              You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
              and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
              or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            </p>
            <p>
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and
              for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole,
              an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works
              that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
              Works thereof.</p>
            <p>
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the
              Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright
              owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
              sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
              lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor
              for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked
              or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
            </p>
            <p>
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by

              2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor

              license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
              the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
              hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
              stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
              transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that
              are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
              Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
              a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
              Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under
              this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
            <p>
              4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
              thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
              the following conditions:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</li>

              <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
              </li>

              <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark,
                and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
                any part of the Derivative Works; and</li>

              <li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
                must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
                notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places:
                within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
                if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
                purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works
                that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional
                attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
                <br>
                <br> You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different
                license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
                Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                with the conditions stated in this License.
              </li>
            </ul>

              5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
              submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
              License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
              or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
            <p>
              6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
              service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing
              the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
            <p>
              7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
              provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES
              OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible
              for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with
              Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
            <p>
              8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
              negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
              acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
              special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of
              the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
              computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
            </p>
            <p>
              9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
              Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
              other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
              You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
              and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by,
              or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

        name:"Ubuntu",
        description:`Ubuntu is a collection of thousands of computer programs and documents created by a range of individuals, teams
              and companies.
            <p>Each of these programs may come under a different licence. This licence policy describes the process that we
              follow in determining which software will be included by default in the Ubuntu operating system.
            </p>
            <p>Copyright licensing and trademarks are two different areas of law, and we consider them separately in Ubuntu.
              The following policy applies only to copyright licences. We evaluate trademarks on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <b>Categories of software in Ubuntu</b>
            <p>The thousands of software packages available for Ubuntu are organised into four key groups or components: main,
              restricted, universe and multiverse. Software is published in one of these components based on whether or not
              it meets our free software philosophy, and the level of support we can provide for it.</p>
            <p>This policy only addresses the software that you will find in main and restricted, which contain software that
              is fully supported by the Ubuntu team and must comply with this policy.
            </p>
            <b>Ubuntu 'main' component licence policy</b>
            <p>All application software included in the Ubuntu main component:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Must include source code. The main component has a strict and non-negotiable requirement that application software
                included in it must come with full source code.</li>
              <li>Must allow modification and distribution of modified copies under the same licence. Just having the source
                code does not convey the same freedom as having the right to change it. Without the ability to modify software,
                the Ubuntu community cannot support software, fix bugs, translate it, or improve it.</li>
            </ul>
            <b>Ubuntu 'main' and 'restricted' component licence policy</b>
            <b>All application software in both main and restricted must meet the following requirements:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Must allow redistribution. Your right to sell or give away the software alone, or as part of an aggregate software
                distribution, is important because:
                <ul>
                  <li>You, the user, must be able to pass on any software you have received from Ubuntu in either source code
                    or compiled form.</li>
                  <li>While Ubuntu will not charge licence fees for this distribution, you might want to charge to print Ubuntu
                    CDs, or create your own customised versions of Ubuntu which you sell, and should have the freedom to
                    do so.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Must not require royalty payments or any other fee for redistribution or modification.It's important that you
                can exercise your rights to this software without having to pay for the privilege, and that you can pass
                these rights on to other people on exactly the same basis.</li>
              <li>Must allow these rights to be passed on along with the software. You should be able to have exactly the same
                rights to the software as we do.</li>
              <li>Must not discriminate against persons, groups or against fields of endeavour. The licence of software included
                in Ubuntu can not discriminate against anyone or any group of users and cannot restrict users from using
                the software for a particular field of endeavour - a business for example. So we will not distribute software
                that is licensed "freely for non-commercial use".
              </li>
              <li>Must not be distributed under a licence specific to Ubuntu. The rights attached to the software must not depend
                on the program being part of Ubuntu system. So we will not distribute software for which Ubuntu has a "special"
                exemption or right, and we will not put our own software into Ubuntu and then refuse you the right to pass
                it on.</li>
              <li>Must not contaminate other software licences.The licence must not place restrictions on other software that
                is distributed along with it. For example, the licence must not insist that all other programmes distributed
                on the same medium be free software.</li>
              <li>May require source modifications to be distributed as patches. In some cases, software authors are happy for
                us to distribute their software and modifications to their software, as long as the two are distributed separately,
                so that people always have a copy of their pristine code. We are happy to respect this preference. However,
                the licence must explicitly permit distribution of software built from modified source code.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Documentation, firmware and drivers</b>
            <p>Ubuntu contains licensed and copyrighted works that are not application software. For example, the default Ubuntu
              installation includes documentation, images, sounds, video clips and firmware. The Ubuntu community will make
              decisions on the inclusion of these works on a case-by-case basis, ensuring that these works do not restrict
              our ability to make Ubuntu available free of charge, and that you can continue to redistribute Ubuntu.
            </p>
            <b>Software installed by default</b>
            <p>When you install Ubuntu, you will typically install a complete desktop environment. It is also possible to install
              a minimal set of software (just enough to boot your machine) and then manually select the precise software
              applications to install. Such a "custom" install is usually favoured by server administrators, who prefer to
              keep only the software they absolutely need on the server.</p>
            <p>All of the application software installed by default is free software. In addition, we install some hardware
              drivers that are available only in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component.
